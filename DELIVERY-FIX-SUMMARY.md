# Delivery Interface Product Mismatch Fix

## Problem Identified
The delivery interface was showing incorrect products (e.g., showing "notebook" when customer ordered "tomatoes") due to:

1. **Enhanced View Data Override**: The delivery dashboard was using `delivery_orders_view` which had incorrect product information
2. **Priority Logic Issue**: The `renderOrderItems` method was prioritizing enhanced view data over actual order items
3. **Data Source Mismatch**: The enhanced view was returning wrong product details

## Root Cause
The `renderOrderItems` method in the delivery dashboard was checking for `order.product_name` and `order.product_image` from the enhanced view first, and using those instead of the actual items from `order.items` array.

## Fix Applied

### 1. Updated `renderOrderItems` method in `js/mango-mart.js`
- **Removed enhanced view priority**: No longer checks for `order.product_name` first
- **Always uses actual order items**: Prioritizes `order.items` array which contains the real product data
- **Simplified logic**: Removed fallback to enhanced view data

### 2. Updated `loadOrders` method in delivery dashboard
- **Direct table access**: Changed from `delivery_orders_view` to direct `orders` table access
- **Eliminated view conflicts**: Avoids potential data mismatches from the enhanced view

### 3. Code Changes Made

#### Before (Problematic):
```javascript
// Check if we have product information from the enhanced view (single product orders)
if (order.product_name && order.product_image) {
    // Use enhanced view data (WRONG!)
    return `<div>${order.product_name}</div>`;
}

// Handle items array (multi-item orders)
if (order.items && Array.isArray(order.items) && order.items.length > 0) {
    // Use actual items (CORRECT but lower priority)
}
```

#### After (Fixed):
```javascript
// ALWAYS prioritize the actual items from the order over enhanced view data
// This ensures we show what was actually ordered, not what the view thinks it is

// Handle items array (multi-item orders) - ALWAYS use this for accurate product display
if (order.items && Array.isArray(order.items) && order.items.length > 0) {
    // Use actual items (CORRECT and highest priority)
}
```

## Expected Results

After applying the fix:
- ✅ Delivery interface will show the correct product that was actually ordered
- ✅ When customer orders tomatoes, delivery interface will show tomatoes (not notebook)
- ✅ Product names, images, and details will match what was ordered
- ✅ No more product mismatches in delivery interface

## Testing

1. **Open `test-delivery-fix.html`** to verify the fix
2. **Test the delivery interface** by:
   - Ordering a specific product (e.g., tomatoes)
   - Logging in as delivery agent
   - Checking that the delivery interface shows the correct product

## Files Modified
- `js/mango-mart.js` - Updated `renderOrderItems` and `loadOrders` methods

## Files Created for Testing
- `test-delivery-fix.html` - Test tool to verify the fix

## Verification
The fix ensures that:
1. **Delivery interface always shows actual order items** from the `items` array
2. **No enhanced view data override** that could cause mismatches
3. **Direct database access** to avoid view-related issues
4. **Consistent product display** between customer and delivery interfaces

This fix resolves the issue where delivery agents were seeing incorrect products (like "notebook" instead of "tomatoes") in their interface.
